# Capstone--Travel-App

## Overview
The Capstone--Travel App is a project developed as part of Udacityâ€™s curriculum. It allows users to input their desired travel location and date, providing information about the weather conditions on that date. If the trip is more than 7 days away, the app forecasts the weather, including the expected high and low temperatures, and displays an image of the location. The app integrates with three external APIs: one for obtaining location coordinates (latitude and longitude), another for weather data, and a third for location images.

### Technical Specifications:
- **Node.js Version:** v20.10.0
- **npm Version:** 10.8.2

## Skills and Technologies Used

### Front-End:
- **API Integration:** Utilized the `axios` library to fetch data from APIs.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Accessed and modified DOM elements using `getElementById` and `querySelector`.
- **UI Updates:** Used `innerHTML` to dynamically update the user interface.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Employed async functions and callback functions to handle API responses and UI updates.
- **Styling:** Designed the user interface with CSS and SASS, focusing on responsive and visually appealing design.

### Back-End:
- **Server Development:** Built a Node.js server using the Express framework to handle client requests and manage API interactions from the server side.
- **Webpack:** Utilized Webpack to bundle and optimize project files, improving efficiency and reducing file sizes.
- **Service Workers:** Implemented service workers to enable offline functionality and cache important assets.
- **Testing:** Created unit tests for various methods using the Jest framework to ensure reliability and correctness of the application.
- **Version Control:** Managed the project using Git and GitHub, including initializing repositories and pushing code updates.
